# Contributing to doc-agent

Thank you for considering contributing to `doc-agent`! This document outlines the process for contributing and the standards we follow.

## Development Process

We follow **The Drill™** for all development work. Please refer to [WORKFLOW.md](./WORKFLOW.md) for the complete guide on finding work, planning, implementing, and submitting changes.

### Quick Summary
1. **Fork and clone** the repository
2. **Install dependencies**: `pnpm install`
3. **Create a branch**: `git checkout -b feature/my-feature`
4. **Make your changes** (following The Drill)
5. **Test your changes**: `pnpm test`
6. **Ensure code quality**: `pnpm lint && pnpm typecheck`

## Commit Message Convention

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for commit messages. This is enforced using commitlint.

Format: `type(scope): subject`

Types:
- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Changes that don't affect code meaning (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code changes that neither fix bugs nor add features
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `test`: Adding or fixing tests
- `chore`: Changes to build process or auxiliary tools

Example:
```
feat(cli): add new search command
fix(extract): handle empty PDF responses
```

## Pull Request Process

1. Update the `README.md` if needed with details of changes to the interface.
2. Add a changeset to document your changes: `pnpm changeset`
3. Create a pull request to the `main` branch.
4. The PR will be reviewed and merged if it meets our standards.

## Adding New Features

See [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md) for architectural details and [WORKFLOW.md](./WORKFLOW.md) for the step-by-step process.

## Testing

- Write tests for all new features and bug fixes.
- Run existing tests to ensure your changes don't break existing functionality.
- Aim for good test coverage.
- Tests are located in `packages/*/src/**/*.test.ts`.

## Code Style

We use Biome for linting and formatting:

- Run `pnpm lint` to check code quality.
- Run `pnpm format` to format the code.

All code must pass linting and typechecking before being merged.

## Versioning

We use [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) to manage versions and generate changelogs.

After making changes:
1. Run `pnpm changeset`
2. Follow the prompts to describe your changes
3. Commit the generated changeset file

## Questions?

If you have any questions, please open an issue or discussion in the repository.
